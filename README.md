# Magic-Card-Evaluation

Here we try to predict the price of Magic the Gathering Trading Cards.
There exists a concept called "bulk" among Magic players and commercial Traders.
A card costing under 1$ is often considered "bulk". Only cards with a price over
1$ are often considered worthy of keeping, buying and trading.
Let's see if we can predict if a card is "bulk" or "non-bulk".
